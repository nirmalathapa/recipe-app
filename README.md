# Recipe App 
A simple recipe app built with Angular7 during the internship as a part of front-end developer training in WireDelta. The list of functionalities in app are create, delete and update recipes, ingredients and shopping list. 

## Motivation & Learning Outcomes
By watchning videos alone does not help in the learning process that is why I downloaded angular scaffolding project from angular cli and solwly developed from scratch. Along the way I faced a lot of problems that was very new to me and not knowing how to actually debug error in angular project. Nonetheless, I managed to google and ask for the help which inded helped me to understand and learn the new concepts that Angular offers what a front-end web app should be. My learnings from this project building are:
using angular cli to build components and services
* Implementing MVC pattern 
* Building scalable and maintainable html & css
* Learned to use TypeScript
* Use Dependency Injection to pass the data without having to change the class
* Creating and subscribing custom events
* Routing
